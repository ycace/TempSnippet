To resolve the issue of missing Visual Studio installation in Jenkins, you can follow the below steps:

1. Install Visual Studio Build Tools: You can download and install Visual Studio Build Tools on your Jenkins machine by following the steps below:

- a. Go to the Visual Studio download page: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.

- b. Under "All downloads" tab, scroll down to the "Tools for Visual Studio" section and click on "Visual Studio Build Tools".

- c. Select the components that you want to install and click on the "Download" button.

- d. Run the downloaded installer file and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

2. Set the correct Visual Studio version: If you have multiple versions of Visual Studio Build Tools installed, you can set the appropriate version in your Jenkinsfile by adding the following code:

```
node {
  withEnv(["msvs_version=2019"]) {
    // your build commands here
  }
}
```
- Replace 2019 with the version of Visual Studio Build Tools you want to use. This code sets the msvs_version environment variable to the specified value for the duration of the build process.

3. Use windows-build-tools: You can also try using the windows-build-tools package in Jenkins by adding the following code to your Jenkinsfile:

```
node {
  bat "npm install --global windows-build-tools"
  // your build commands here
}
```
- This code installs the windows-build-tools package using the npm command in a Windows batch file (bat), and then runs your build commands.

Once you have made the necessary changes to your Jenkinsfile, save and commit the changes, and then run your Jenkins pipeline to test the build process.
